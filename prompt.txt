📱 Cursor Prompt: Recipe Finder Mobile App (Expo + React Native)
App Overview

Build a cross-platform native mobile recipe application using Expo + React Native that allows users to discover, search, and view recipes from a public recipe API. The app should be optimized for iOS, Android, and Web, and structured so it can be deployed to Vercel for the web version and Expo for mobile builds.

The app should feel modern, fast, and visually appealing, with clean navigation and reusable components.

Technical Requirements

Framework: Expo (React Native)

Language: TypeScript

Routing: Expo Router

State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Data Fetching: fetch or axios

Environment Variables: Expo-compatible (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*)

Compatible with Vercel Web Deployment

Clean folder structure and scalable architecture

API Integration

Use a free, public recipe API such as:

Base URL: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/

Endpoints:

Search by name: /search.php?s={query}

Deployment Readiness

Ensure the app runs on:

iOS

Android

Web

Must be compatible with Vercel:

expo export or expo build:web

No platform-specific native dependencies

Environment variables should be web-safe

Include a basic README.md with setup instructions

Output Expectations

Generate complete, runnable code

Use TypeScript

Include comments where helpful

Provide sample API responses handling

Avoid placeholders unless necessary

Code should run immediately after:

npm install
npx expo start
